For most of my academic/scientific career I have focused on scientific research in theoretical condensed matter physics, theoretical chemistry and experimental physical chemistry. I worked with diverse and large amounts of data to build theoretical models to execute in simulations. I live and breath data (e.g. passion projects, Kaggle competitions, MeetUps). Machine learning and advanced analytics has always caught my attention and now that technologies (software/hardware) are more accessible for advanced ML/AI practices, I actively searching for opportunities to participate as a data professional in the industry.

My professional training in Data Science/Big data engineering consist of academic courses (at Caltech and University of Washington,Seattle) and MOOCs (three Udacity Nanodegrees, DataCamp, 365DataScience, Intellipaat). As a summary of academic and professional experience see below diagrams.
