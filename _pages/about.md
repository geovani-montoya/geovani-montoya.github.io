6+ year of experience in data analysis and model development in theoretical condensed matter physics, theoretical chemistry and experimental physical chemistry. I worked with diverse and large amounts of data to build theoretical models and execute simulations representing chemical/physical phenomena. I live and breath data, not just in the laboratory (e.g. passion projects, Kaggle competitions, MeetUps). Machine learning and advanced analytics has always caught my attention and now that technologies (software/hardware) are more accessible for advanced ML/AI practices, I am actively searching for opportunities to transfer my quantitative skills as a data professional in the industry.

Below is a summary/timeline of my academic, research, professional development and professional experience.
